Welcome to the RIT Player Piano Project (2022-2023)!

This program is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi (version XXXX) 
and paired with the RIT Player Piano via MIDI cable, 
or any dedicated MIDI device. Additionally, this program can be run on any
Windows PC (version XX or newer) and will use the "Windows Built-in Synthesizer."

To run this program, simply double-click the "main.exe" located in
the "\RIT Player Piano" folder. On Windows this will likely be
"C:\Program Files (x86)\RIT Player Piano".
